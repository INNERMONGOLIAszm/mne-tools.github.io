        "\n\nIntroduction to Python\n======================\n\n`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ is a modern general-purpose object-oriented\nhigh-level programming language. First make sure you have a working Python\nenvironment and dependencies (see `install_python_and_mne_python`). If you\nare completely new to Python, don't worry, it's just like any other programming\nlanguage, only easier. Here are a few great resources to get you started:\n\n* `SciPy lectures <http://scipy-lectures.github.io>`_\n* `Learn X in Y minutes: Python <https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/>`_\n* `NumPy for MATLAB users <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html>`_\n\nWe highly recommend watching the SciPy videos and reading through these sites\nto get a sense of how scientific computing is done in Python.\n\n"
