========================================================
Compute real-time evoked responses using moving averages
========================================================

This example demonstrates how to connect to an MNE Real-time server
using the RtClient and use it together with RtEpochs to compute
evoked responses using moving averages.

Note: The MNE Real-time server (mne_rt_server), which is part of mne-cpp,
has to be running on the same computer.
