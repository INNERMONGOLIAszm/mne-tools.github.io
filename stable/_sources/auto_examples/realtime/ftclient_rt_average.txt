========================================================
Compute real-time evoked responses with FieldTrip client
========================================================

This example demonstrates how to connect the MNE real-time
system to the Fieldtrip buffer using FieldTripClient class.

This example was tested in simulation mode

neuromag2ft --file MNE-sample-data/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_raw.fif

using a modified version of neuromag2ft available at

http://neuro.hut.fi/~mainak/neuromag2ft-2.0.0.zip

to run the FieldTrip buffer. Then running this example acquires the
data on the client side.

Since the Fieldtrip buffer does not contain all the
measurement information required by the MNE real-time processing
pipeline, an info dictionary must be provided to instantiate FieldTripClient.
Alternatively, the MNE-Python script will try to guess the missing
measurement info from the Fieldtrip Header object.

Together with RtEpochs, this can be used to compute evoked
responses using moving averages.
