==============================================
Real-time feedback for decoding :: Server Side
==============================================

This example demonstrates how to setup a real-time feedback
mechanism using StimServer and StimClient.

The idea here is to display future stimuli for the class which
is predicted less accurately. This allows on-demand adaptation
of the stimuli depending on the needs of the classifier.

To run this example, open ipython in two separate terminals.
In the first, run rt_feedback_server.py and then wait for the
message

    RtServer: Start

Once that appears, run rt_feedback_client.py in the other terminal
and the feedback script should start.

All brain responses are simulated from a fiff file to make it easy
to test. However, it should be possible to adapt this script
for a real experiment.
